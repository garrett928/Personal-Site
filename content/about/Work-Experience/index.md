<!-- ![Ah Huddersfield](images/cycling-collage.PNG "Some lovely Huddersfield hills, one of the trusty bikes!") -->
While pursing my Electrical Enigneering degree from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu) I founded and led a nationally competitive rocketry program, organized a funding campaign to bring $100,000+ to the universities Innovation Center, architected and built an exterprise server rack for my peers, devoted 1000's of hours to mentoring [FIRST](https://firstinspires.org) robotics programs, and worked 15 hr/week to support myself through school. Throughout these endoviors, I was nominated and awarded mulitple [honors](#honors-and-awards) for my work ethic, character, and impact on those around me. Along with my coursework, these projects helped stregthen my electrical background and software development skills that I apply to my current job as an Electrical Engineer.
