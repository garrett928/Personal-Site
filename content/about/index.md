I'm an engineer with an electrical background and years of practical, hands on software development experience. While pursing Electrical Engineering from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu) I founded and led a natioanlly competitive rocketry program, architectured and built an enterprise server rack for my peers, organized a funding campaing to bring $100,000+ to the univeristy [Innovation Center](https://firstinspires.org), devoted 1000's of hours to mentoring [FIRST](https://firstinspires.org) robotics programs, and worked 15 hr/week to support myself through school. Throughout these endoviors, I was nominated and awarded mulitple [reconignations of honor](#honors-and-awards) for my work either, character, and impact on those around me.
