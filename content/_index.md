Hi, I'm Garrett!  
 I'm a Software Engineer at [MISO](https://www.misoenergy.org/) working to help ensure the reliable and efficent operation of the midwest power grid! My interest are in power systems, embedded systems, computer networking, and dev ops. I love working on small, fast paced teams under pressure to solve complex technical problems. In my free time I enjoy making projects, hanging out with friends, running, and bowling. I'm also a [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) mentor of 10 years. In this website you'll find more information [about me]({{< ref "/about" >}}) and the [projects]({{< ref "/projects">}}) I like to work on.
