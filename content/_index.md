Hi, I'm Garrett. Currently, I'm an Electrical Engineer at [DEKA Research and Development](https://dekaresearch.com/). I love working on small, fast paced teams under pressure to solve complex technical problems. My interest are in embedded systems, circuits, networking, and power systems. In my free time I enjoy making projects, hanging out with friends, running, and bowling. I'm also a [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) mentor of 10 years.
