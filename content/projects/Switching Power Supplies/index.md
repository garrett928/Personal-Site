# Overview
During college I took an intro to switching power supplies course as an elective. During the 10 week period, my lab partner and I designed and built a linear PSU (120V AC -> 15V DC), a boost converter (12-14V -> 25V), and a buck boost converter (12-14V -> -25V). This was a very hands on course which tought me many practical skills. My biggest take away from this course was the impact of layout on the performance of a circuit, or even if the circuit works at all.
