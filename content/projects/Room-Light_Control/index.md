# Overview
During my freshman year I wanted a way to turn on and off a set of lights in my room without getting out of bed. Although slightly overkill, I decided to make a latching circuit. This is the prototype of the circuit.

Here is my latching circuit on perf board and mounted to my loft. It's nothing fancy but served its purpose and I used it many times a day for the entire year. It never failed me! The latch would toggle a relay, which turned on and off a set of rope lights. Something scrappy I did was take a usb charging brick and steal the 5V pins from its output USB to get 5V to my circuit from AC wall power.
