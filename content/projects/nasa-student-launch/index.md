• Milled and machined rocket components for the competition airframe
• Waterjet components for the competition airframe
• Assisted in the rocket design and assembly during competition launches

• Established Rose-Hulman’s first rocketry competition team, growing to 40 active students within two years
• Logged 1000+ hours of design and fabrication work in less than 2 years while enrolled full time and working 15-20 hr/wk
• Led competition manufacturing and technical documentation, 600+ pages, for a rocket with specifications: 5,000 ft apogee, 13 ft length, 5.5 in diameter, 2.38 kN thrust, and electronically controlled air brakes
• Presented complex technical information to a panel of NASA engineers through a series of three design reviews in one year
• We notably grew from a group of 5 people that never launched anything bigger than a C motor to building a 13 ft tall rocket, on an L motor, that flew a mile high and flew a never before seen (on a college team) pneumatic flight control system in 1.5 years

Thousands of hours and handwork and dedication have been poured into this team to bring it from a couple friends using a borrowed workbench and tools to a tight-knit team of students with their own workspace and resources.

Rocketry all team photo from October 2023. This is compared to the first team picture in 2020 with three of us at a lunch field with our rockets. What I started as a fun project with a couple friends has taken a life of its own and now host over 40 students doing everything developing liquid rocket engines to cube satellites for NASA.

In 2020, this was the beginning of Rose Rocketry. We were allowed two tables and some chairs placed at the back of our schools concrete canoe competition team. We slowly nudged back the tables, to the annoyance of concrete canoe, to where you see in this picture to allow us to sit at the bench without blocking the aisle behind us.

Rose Rocketry's very first launch and my first time flying high powered rockets! This launch was the beginning of what would later define a majority of my time and effort at college. It was a fast paced and journey to take rocketry from the group of friends you see in this image to the team you see later in the second image!
