[{"content":" Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Garrett!\nI\u0026rsquo;m an Electrical Engineer at DEKA Research and Development. My interest are in power systems, embedded systems, circuits, and computer networking. I love working on small, fast paced teams under pressure to solve complex technical problems. In my free time I enjoy making projects, hanging out with friends, running, and bowling. I\u0026rsquo;m also a FIRST Robotics mentor of 10 years. In this website you\u0026rsquo;ll find more information about me and the projects I like to work on.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home Page","summary":"","title":"Home Page"},{"content":"Overview #I wanted to make a christmas gift for some family members and I came up with this. My roommate had designed this maple leaf with our school logo in the center for the school to 3D print and give out. I thought it would be really cool to waterjet the leaf out of metal and paint it. And then the idea snowballed from there\u0026hellip; What I ended up with was a combination of an electrical and woodworking project. Part of what made this a cool project was how many tools I got to use making it: waterjet, table router, hand router, sand blaster, soldering tools, lab bench supplies, etc. I did change from a 2K resistor for the LEDS. My batteries ended up giving me around a 6V supply. The LEDS are not at full brightness because there are 8 of them. But, that\u0026rsquo;s ok for this project. Dimmer is actually better for what I wanted.\nI used a simple RC circuit to hold the base of a mosfet on to keep the LEDS on. There is a small button routed into the side of the wood, where the black paint is on the left of this image. Knowing the time constant, tau, is RC, and that in 4 tau a circuit will charge to, or discharge to, ~98% of its final value, I found a RC pair that got me a few seconds of on time as a starting value. I played with the values on a breadboard from there to see what values I liked. Because the charge and discharge is exponential the lights ended up with a nice fade effect too.\nThe hardest part of this mini project ended up being the batteries! Making a battery holder was surprisingly difficult! Not it theory, but in practice\u0026hellip; I also tried to make a diffuser for the LEDS by putting a layer of epoxy in front of them. This worked ok but not great.\n","date":"Janurary 10, 2023","permalink":"/projects/light-up-engraved-wood-logo/","section":"Projects","summary":"Blending wood working and electronics","title":"Light Up Engraved Wooden Logo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"Overview #This is a CAN bus project I made for a short, 2 week final project. The project goal was to simulate a car can bus with two MCU\u0026rsquo;s. One MCU read sensor input and sent it over the CAN bus. The other read data from the CAN bus and displayed the status of the sensors. I wrote a SPI driver for the texas instruments board, because it lacked a CAN peripheral onboard, a library using my SPI driver for a SPI to CAN controller, a CAN driver for a STM32 board, and application code for each MCU (including configuring all the peripheral registers, interrupts, ADCs, and timers). In this image I am verifying my library for the SPI to CAN controller. Specifically, I am looking at SPI frames coming from my library and comparing them against the controllers datasheet. I have an arduino connected with the same controller on the CAN bus running a known, good and tested library to verify if my library was sending and receiving CAN messages correctly.

During the 10 week period, my lab partner and I designed and built a linear power supply (120V AC -\u0026gt; 15V DC), a boost converter (12-14V -\u0026gt; 25V), and a buck boost converter (12-14V -\u0026gt; -25V). This was a very hands on course which tought me many practical skills. My biggest take away from this course was the impact of layout on the performance of a circuit, or even if the circuit works at all.\nBoost Converter # A boost converter I built in 2023 for a power supply course. The converter is built for 12-14V in and 25V out at 2A. During this course I also built a 120V AC-DC linear power supply, also rated for 25V at 2A.\nShown here is the bottom of the boost converter. We used wire wrapping instead of soldering for any non-high current connections. This largely due to preference of the instructor, but it was a nice skill to learn and definitely had some advantages during debugging with easily being able to unwrap a pin on an IC.\nHere is my annotated schematic for the boost converter. For this course we were taught the theory and operation of various power supply typologies and then had to go actually design and build them. Although we were provided the schematic for the labs, this was to speed up the lab process to complete building three power supplies in 10 weeks. Most parts were calculated and then picked by the students, as seen by the empty part values on the schematic. I used mathcad and some equations for a boost converter, along with IC datasheets, to pick components to guarantee output ripple, output voltage and switching time.\nBuck Converter # The third power supply I built was a buck-boost converter for 12-14V in and -25V out at 2A.\nShown here is the bottom of the buck-boost supply. Something that I learned from this project was the careful consideration for the physical construction of a switching power supply. Specifically, the need to minimize the area of the two high current loops on the input and output because of their ability to create lots of EMI. This was actually an issue for my power supply that was hard to debug. The issue was that there was so much noise being generated that the current sense wire on the SG2535A would pick up the noise and trigger the current limit, a pulse-by-pulse current limit, turning off the gate driver for that pulse and turning off the power supply output.\nHere is the schematic for the buck-bojpegost converter. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;ve lost my annotated notes for this power supply. This power supply I actually struggled to get the last piece working (the -12V inverting charge pump shown in the middle right). The charge pump is driven by a 555 timer and is used to supply the negative rail to the LM324 op amp.\n","date":"Janurary 10, 2023","permalink":"/projects/switching-power-supplies/","section":"Projects","summary":"A boost and buckboost power supply","title":"Switching Power Supples"},{"content":"Overview #During my freshman year I wanted a way to turn on and off a set of lights in my room without getting out of bed. Although slightly overkill, I decided to make a latching circuit. This is the prototype of the circuit.\nHere is my latching circuit on perf board and mounted to my loft. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing fancy but served its purpose and I used it many times a day for the entire year. It never failed me! The latch would toggle a relay, which turned on and off a set of rope lights. Something scrappy I did was take a usb charging brick and steal the 5V pins from its output USB to get 5V to my circuit from AC wall power.
