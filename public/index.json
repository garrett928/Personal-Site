[{"content":" Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Garrett. I\u0026rsquo;m an Electrical Engineer at DEKA Research and Development. I love working on small, fast paced teams under pressure to solve complex technical problems. My interest are in power systems, embedded systems, circuits, and computer networking. In my free time I enjoy making projects, hanging out with friends, running, and bowling. I\u0026rsquo;m also a FIRST Robotics mentor of 10 years.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home Page","summary":"","title":"Home Page"},{"content":"Overview #During college I took an intro to switching power supplies course as an elective.

This was a very hands on course which tought me many practical skills. My biggest take away from this course was the impact of layout on the performance of a circuit, or even if the circuit works at all.\n","date":"Janurary 10, 2023","permalink":"/projects/light-up-engraved-wood-logo/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Light Up Engraved Wooden Logo"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"Overview #","date":"Janurary 10, 2023","permalink":"/projects/simulated-car-can-bus/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Simulated Car CAN Bus"},{"content":"Overview #During college I took an intro to switching power supplies course as an elective.
