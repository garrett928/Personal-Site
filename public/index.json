[{"content":"NOT MY PROJECT! Example post from here #2020 -\u0026gt; 2022\nDartsNow was a passion project between myself good friend from the University of Huddersfield. It came about due to our historic interest in darts which grew out of our university accommodation. Throughout the pandemic period we had no way to get together and play, so as a result DartsNow was born!\nDartsNow offered users a platform to sign up, play a standard format of darts. Each user could setup a game with a custom amount of legs they wanted to play, and to a total of 701, 501, 301, 101. It processed each set of darts thrown, calculated statistics from each game, while also offering peer to peer video via WebRTC to communicate with friends as you played.\nFeatures # Web front end designed with mobile first focus User registration Live Darts Scoring Peer to Peer video calling within a match Match History Stats and Scoring Tech Bits # Spring Boot Backend Thymeleaf Templated Front End Material UI Design Websocket implementation for live scoring WebRTC integration Metrics using Micrometer, stored and visualised using Prometheus \u0026amp; Grafana. The project has ceased to exist at the moment. But you can find out lots of information from our public twitter page about what we got up to.\nCalling all online dart players... The DartsNow alpha is live and we want you to get involved. So grab your phone, a few friends and show us your scores, checkouts and miscalculations!
