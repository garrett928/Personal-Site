[{"content":"\rHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Garrett. Currently, I\u0026rsquo;m an Electrical Engineer at DEKA Research and Development. I love working on small, fast paced teams under pressure to solve complex technical problems. My interest are in embedded systems, circuits, networking, and power systems. In my free time I enjoy making projects, hanging out with friends, running, and bowling. I\u0026rsquo;m also a FIRST Robotics mentor of 10 years.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Home Page","summary":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Garrett.","title":"Home Page"},{"content":"Overview #During college I took an intro to switching power supplies course as an elective.
